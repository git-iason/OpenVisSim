# OpenVisSim: a Unity3D, data-driven sight-loss simulator, for for Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR)

### About
OpenVisSim is a free library for simulating many of the common symptoms associated with eye diseases (e.g., glaucoma, AMD, diabetic retinopahty, etc.). It is written primarily in OpenGL shaders, so supports most commercial VR/AR hardware.  Eye-tracking is also supported and is HIGHLY recommended. For this reason, I have not released an 'app' version of the software on iTunes or Google Play. OpenVisSIm is not suitable for simulating refractive error (long- or short-sightedness). For that, just try wearing the wrong glasses =)

### Quick Start: Setting up
Download the project. Open the demo scene "Demo1_Fove\MainScene.unity" in the Unity Editor, and run (NB: doesn't require any hardware to be connected, though will mirror to a Fove0 headset if connected). By default the mouse will be used to simulate the observer's gaze. Filters can be modified by toggling the post-processing effects attached to each eye.

**Further details:**
When effects are linked, the right eye automatically copies the parameters from the left eye. A second demo is also included, designed to use the HTC Vive Eye with ZEDm cameras for AR.

### System Requirements
**Operating system:**
Any system that supports Unity3D. Can export to most VR/Ar hardware. So far we have successfully tested it with the Tobii HTC Vive, Fove0, and iPhone 7 (w/ google cardboard).

**Programming language:**
Unity 2017.4.1f1

**Dependencies:**
None (?)

**License:**
GNU GPL v3.0
